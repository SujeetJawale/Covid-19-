# Covid-19-

We are creating a data analysis project on spread of novel coronavirus in India the project use raw data in form of .csv and .xls files and transform it into data analysis. This project is an attempt of Data Analysis Coronavirus covid-19 is spread in India with the help of data science and Data Analytics in python code. This data will help us to find the basis behind common notions about the virus spread from purely a data set perspective.

The data used for this project is split across two files :
1. covid_19_india.csv
2. Indian_coordinates.xls

For the analysis we use some libraries such as Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, stdlib, folium, warnings and fbprophets in the project we import files by using user defined functions we clean the data. In the first part of the workshop, we will use Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to download, clean, analyze and visualize the coronavirus open dataset. And after that we are going to visualise the spread geographically we use Folium. And then with scatter plot, line plot and bar plot we have visualized the data in graphs. And at the end Fbprophet is used for visualization using graphs and proper visualization is done.
